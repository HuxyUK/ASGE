# ASGE
ASGE is a simple modern OpenGL framework designed to allow for rapid prototyping of 2D games. It specifically aims to reduce the complexity of larger game engines and frameworks. The engine itself is written in modern C++. Over the years the scope of the framework has changed to include many more features, allowing for complex 2D environments and games to be developed.

At the time of writing over 1000+ games have been created using ASGE.
